# CodingTheMatrix

This repository has code for the homework and projects for Coding The Matrix, a linear algebra class designed for CS students.

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a chapter covered in the book.  Chapters 10 and 13 are not included as they are not covered by the course lectures.  There is a link below for my handwritten notes and a couple handwritten homework assignments.
