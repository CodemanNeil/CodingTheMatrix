Each folder in this repository corresponds to a chapter covered in the book.  Chapters 10 and 13 are not included as they are not covered by the course lectures.  I may return at a later time and finish them.

Note: The data for the pagerank lab is not included in the repository as it was over the filesize limit for GitHub.  That data can be downloaded on the course resource page.
